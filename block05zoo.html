      <!--Short description of animal with link for more info-->
      Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified as
      caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears
      are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats
      throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern
      Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South
      America, and Eurasia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large
      bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair,
      plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.

    <h2>Giraffes</h2>
    <p>
      The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus
      Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest
      ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one
      species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently,
      researchers proposed dividing them into four extant species due to new
      research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and individual species
      can be distinguished by their fur coat patterns. Seven other extinct
      species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.

    <h2>Lions</h2>
    <p>
      The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to
      Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded
      head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is
      sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a
      prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A
      lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.
      Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on
      medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone
      predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have
      been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and
      prey on humans.

    <h2>Monkeys</h2>
    <p>
      Spider monkeys are New World monkeys belonging to the genus Ateles, part
      of the subfamily Atelinae, family Atelidae. Like other atelines, they are
      found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from southern
      Mexico to Brazil. The genus consists of seven species, all of which are
      under threat; the brown spider monkey is critically endangered. They are
      also notable for their ability to be easily bred in captivity.

    <h2>Alligators</h2>
    <p>
      The American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), sometimes referred to
      as a gator or common alligator, is a large crocodilian reptile native to
      the Southeastern United States and a small section of northeastern Mexico.
      It is one of the two extant species in the genus Alligator, and is larger
      than the only other living alligator species, the Chinese alligator.
